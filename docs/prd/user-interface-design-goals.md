# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

BrickOps will provide an intuitive, mobile-first web application that streamlines the complex workflow of Lego reselling. The interface will prioritize speed and accuracy, with the camera-based part identification as the primary entry point. The design will feel modern and professional while remaining approachable for users of varying technical comfort levels. The core experience will be built around three main workflows: identify parts, manage inventory, and process orders - with seamless transitions between each.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Camera-First Design**: Mobile camera and webcam integration will be prominently featured with large, easy-to-use capture buttons and clear visual feedback
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live inventory changes and order processing will be reflected immediately across all views using Convex subscriptions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features will be revealed gradually as users become more comfortable with the platform
- **Contextual Actions**: Actions will be contextually relevant based on current inventory status and user workflow stage
- **Visual Part Recognition**: Strong emphasis on visual elements with high-quality part images and clear identification results

## Core Screens and Views

- **Part Identification Screen**: Camera interface with capture button, confidence indicators, and manual verification options
- **Inventory Dashboard**: Overview of current inventory levels, recent changes, and quick access to common actions
- **Part Detail View**: Comprehensive part information including images, pricing, and inventory status
- **Order Management Table**: Unified table view of orders from both Bricklink and Brickowl with sorting, filtering, selection, and export capabilities
- **Pick Session Interface**: Part-by-part picking interface with visual part cards, progress tracking, and issue resolution tools
- **Issue Resolution Modal**: Comprehensive tools for finding alternative inventory, viewing sorting grid locations, and adjusting inventory levels
- **TODO List Dashboard**: Management interface for parts requiring refunds or resolution with order tracking and reporting
- **Sorting Grid Display**: Simple display of sorting grid/bin locations (e.g., C303) for parts
- **Document Generation**: Interface for downloading order stickers, pick sheets, and CSV exports
- **Catalog Search**: Search and browse functionality for the Lego parts catalog
- **User Management**: Account owner interface for inviting, managing, and removing team members with role assignment
- **Settings Page**: User preferences, API configurations, and account management
- **Inventory Change History**: Detailed audit trail of all inventory modifications

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will meet WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities, including proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and alternative text for all images.

## Branding

Clean, modern design with a professional feel that conveys reliability and efficiency. Color scheme should be neutral and non-distracting to allow Lego part images to be the visual focus. Consider subtle Lego-inspired design elements without being overly playful, maintaining business credibility.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Web-responsive design optimized for mobile devices (primary usage) while providing full functionality on desktop. The application will work seamlessly across all modern browsers and screen sizes, with particular attention to mobile camera integration and touch-friendly interfaces.
