## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Catalog data schema and reference seeding (AC: 2.2.1, 2.2.3, 2.2.5)

  - [ ] Extend `convex/schema.ts` LegoPartCatalog table with search keywords, primary/available color ids, category path arrays, market price fields, and supporting indexes for part number + description lookups. Add indexes for searchKeywords (text search), colorIds (array filtering), and categoryPath (hierarchical filtering) to support efficient search and filter operations. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#legopartcatalog; docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#catalog-data-refresh-lifecycle]
  - [ ] Create Convex tables for Bricklink color, category, part-color availability, and element reference data and wire them to BusinessAccount scoped seeds. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#bricklinkcolorreference; docs/architecture/data-models.md#bricklinkpartcoloravailability; docs/architecture/data-models.md#bricklinkelementreference]
  - [ ] Build a seeding script at `scripts/catalog/seed-reference-data.ts` that uses streaming/chunked parsing (via xml-stream or SAX parser) to process large Bricklink XML datasets without exhausting memory. Implement batching strategy with configurable batch sizes (default 1000 records) and progress logging to avoid execution timeouts. Load baseline XML exports from `docs/external-documentation/bricklink-data/*.xml` and the BrickOps sort lookup (`bin_lookup_v3.json`) into the new reference tables, capturing sync timestamps; document execution via `pnpm ts-node scripts/catalog/seed-reference-data.ts` for local bootstrap and CI seeding. [Source: docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md#bricklink-data-exports-brickops-baseline; docs/architecture/data-models.md#bricklinkcolorreference]

- [ ] Task 2: Backend search filters and refresh pipeline (AC: 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.5, 2.2.7)

  - [ ] Update `convex/functions/catalog.ts` `searchParts` to query keywords, part numbers, sort grid/bin, and color/category filters with pagination cursors and aligned tenant isolation. Implement pagination with sane defaults (pageSize: 25, max: 100) and server-side caps to keep responses manageable for huge result sets. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#catalog-data-refresh-lifecycle; docs/stories/1.5.basic-catalog-management-system.story.md#dev-notes]
  - [ ] Introduce helper functions to surface filter metadata (colors, categories, attribute counts) via Convex queries backed by the new reference tables. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#catalogservice; docs/architecture/data-models.md#bricklinkcolorreference]
  - [ ] Implement Bricklink refresh orchestration that fans out to `/items/part`, `/items/part/{no}`, `/items/part/{no}/price`, and `/colors`/`/categories` when data is stale, caching results and respecting rate limits/backoff. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#catalogservice; docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md#performance-optimization; docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md]
  - [ ] Record catalog search latency metrics and flag fallback usage to enforce the ≤2s SLA. [Source: docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#key-metrics; docs/prd/epic-2-part-identification-catalog-integration.md#story-22-catalog-search-and-browse]

- [ ] Task 3: Catalog search UI and interaction flows (AC: 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.7)

  - [ ] Build the authenticated catalog page with search input, responsive layout, and result grid backed by `useQuery(api.catalog.searchParts)` to surface catalog data in real time. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture; docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
  - [ ] Add filter controls for color, category, and persisted attributes using a new Zustand store exported from `src/hooks/useSearchStore.ts` so selections survive pagination and reloads. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
  - [ ] Implement `useSearchStore` with shape `{ query, selectedColors, selectedCategories, page, pageSize, sort, setFilters, resetFilters }`, ensure it hydrates from URL params, and persist in local storage for authenticated sessions. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
  - [ ] Implement pagination and page-size controls with accessible shadcn/ui primitives while maintaining mobile-first responsiveness. Consider UI list virtualization or incremental rendering for dense result grids to keep the frontend responsive when navigating large catalog slices. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#shadcnui-component-installation; docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#design-tokens]
  - [ ] Render each result with part number, name, description snippet, primary image, category tag, color chips, BrickOps sort grid/bin, and data source indicators. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#legopartcatalog; docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md]
  - [ ] Provide loading, empty, and error states with actionable copy and retry options inline with the error handling strategy. [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

- [ ] Task 4: Part detail experience and market pricing (AC: 2.2.2, 2.2.6, 2.2.7)

  - [ ] Present a detail drawer/modal from search results that surfaces extended metadata, imagery, available colors, and availability context using shadcn/ui patterns. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture; docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#shadcnui-component-installation]
  - [ ] Leverage CatalogService `getPartDetails` plus Bricklink price guide endpoints to display market pricing, color variations, and data freshness indicators. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#catalogservice; docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md#get-item; docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md#get-item-price]
  - [ ] Handle Bricklink fetch failures by falling back to cached details and communicating status to the user. [Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md#performance-optimization; docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

- [ ] Task 5: Comprehensive validation and testing (AC: 2.2.1, 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5, 2.2.6, 2.2.7)

  - [ ] Add frontend tests covering search submission, filter interactions, pagination, detail drawer, and error boundaries with required data-testid attributes. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests; docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-id-guidelines]
  - [ ] Extend backend catalog function tests for new filters, pagination, Bricklink refresh orchestration, and rate-limit enforcement. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
  - [ ] Create or update E2E scenarios to exercise search → filter → pagination → detail view workflows with mocked Convex and Bricklink responses. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#e2e-tests]
  - [ ] Capture performance evidence (unit or integration measurement) showing typical queries complete within the required 2-second SLA.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Part identification now validates Bricklink part numbers via CatalogService, so search flows must surface consistent catalog metadata for identification confirmations. [Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#part-identification-and-inventory-addition; docs/stories/2.1.camera-integration-and-part-identification.story.md#dev-notes]
- Catalog foundations already enforce tenant isolation, caching tiers, and Bricklink rate budgeting that this story must extend rather than replace. [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-catalog-management-system.story.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models

- `LegoPartCatalog` stores partNumber, name, category, imageUrl, bricklinkPartId, dataSource, and dataFreshness, forming the primary dataset for search results. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#legopartcatalog]
- Business accounts define tenant boundaries; all catalog queries must filter by businessAccountId to preserve isolation. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#businessaccount]

### Reference Data Baseline

- Bricklink XML exports for parts, colors, categories, item types, codes, and minifigures plus the BrickOps sort-grid lookup (`bin_lookup_v3.json`) are checked in under `docs/external-documentation/bricklink-data/` and must seed the Convex reference tables before live traffic. Seed these via the catalog bootstrap script at `scripts/catalog/seed-reference-data.ts`. [Source: docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md#bricklink-data-exports-brickops-baseline]
- `BricklinkColorReference`, `BricklinkCategoryReference`, and `BricklinkPartColorAvailability` tables back color chips, filter metadata, and stale detection, while `BricklinkElementReference` exposes LEGO element IDs per part-color for detail panels and exports. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#bricklinkcolorreference; docs/architecture/data-models.md#bricklinkpartcoloravailability; docs/architecture/data-models.md#bricklinkelementreference]
- Execute `pnpm ts-node scripts/catalog/seed-reference-data.ts` locally and in CI to hydrate reference tables and capture sync timestamps before enabling search. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#catalog-data-refresh-lifecycle]

### Bricklink API Strategy

- Treat LegoPartCatalog records older than 7 days as candidates for refresh and older than 30 days as expired; persist `lastFetchedFromBricklink` timestamps. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#catalog-data-refresh-lifecycle]
- Combine `/items/part`, `/items/part/{no}`, `/items/part/{no}/price`, and taxonomy endpoints to rebuild stale part entries while respecting shared rate limits/backoff policies. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#catalogservice; docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md]
- Record freshness metrics and fallback usage so Bricklink dependency health is observable. [Source: docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#key-metrics]

### Search and Filter Requirements

- Search must tokenize part number, description, alias, and sort location fields into `searchKeywords` so partial queries succeed. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#legopartcatalog]
- Color, category, and data-source filters pull from reference tables and should expose counts for UX hints. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#bricklinkcolorreference]
- Maintain market pricing fields (`marketPrice`, `marketPriceLastSyncedAt`) for detail view display and stale detection, and hydrate `sortGrid`/`sortBin` so catalog rows display BrickOps location context. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#legopartcatalog]
- The Zustand store should expose derived selectors for active filters and reset logic so pagination resets when filters change, keeping UI and backend queries aligned. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

### API Specifications

- CatalogService exposes `searchParts`, `getPartDetails`, `refreshPartData`, `batchImportParts`, and `validateDataFreshness`, which should remain the integration surface for UI and automation. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#catalogservice]
- Bricklink integrations require OAuth 1.0a credentials and must respect the 5,000 calls/day quota with budgeting/monitoring. [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#bricklink-oauth-10a-credentials]
- Use Bricklink catalog endpoints for item metadata and imagery as needed (`GET /items/{type}/{no}`) and price guides for market pricing (`GET /items/{type}/{no}/price`). [Source: docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md#get-item; docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md#get-item-price]
- Fetch color and category taxonomies from `/colors` and `/categories` endpoints to populate filter controls. [Source: docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md#get-color-list; docs/external-documentation/apis/bricklink.md#get-category-list]

### Component Specifications

- The authenticated catalog route lives under `app/(authenticated)/catalog` and should use server-aware layouts that align with other dashboard pages. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]
- Server state for the catalog is accessed with `useQuery(api.catalog.searchParts)`, while persistent filter state should leverage the new Zustand store exported from `src/hooks/useSearchStore.ts`. Hydrate the store from query parameters on mount and keep URL/search params in sync on change. Use default pageSize of 25 items with maximum of 100 items per page, enforced server-side to prevent resource exhaustion from huge result sets. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- Frontend service wrappers in `src/lib/services` consolidate Convex calls and error handling; follow the pattern used in `src/lib/services/part-identification-service.ts` when introducing a `CatalogService` helper. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#frontend-services-layer]
- UI should rely on shadcn/ui components installed via the CLI and adhere to design tokens for typography, spacing, and responsiveness. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#shadcnui-component-installation; docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#design-tokens]

### File Locations

- Backend catalog logic continues in `convex/functions/catalog.ts`, with any shared helpers residing alongside existing external clients. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-architecture-serverless]
- Frontend implementations should augment `src/app/(authenticated)/catalog/page.tsx` and related catalog components under `src/components/`. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture; docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- Client-side service helpers and utilities belong in `src/lib/services/catalog-service.ts` following existing patterns. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#frontend-services-layer]
- Tests live under `__tests__/frontend/app`, `__tests__/backend`, and `e2e/` per the testing strategy structure. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests; docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests; docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#e2e-tests]

### Technical Constraints

- Validate every Convex request with authentication, tenant isolation, and Zod-style input guards to meet security requirements. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization; docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md#security-requirements]
- Maintain caching-first lookups with Bricklink fallback only when local data is stale, targeting sub-2-second responses for common queries. [Source: docs/stories/1.5.basic-catalog-management-system.story.md#qa-results; docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md#performance-optimization]
- Record Convex metrics for search latency, fallback usage, and Bricklink quota consumption to aid observability. [Source: docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#key-metrics]
- Enforce API quota budgets and exponential backoff when interacting with Bricklink to avoid throttling. [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#bricklink-oauth-10a-credentials; docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md#security-requirements]
- Provide structured error objects so the UI can surface actionable feedback during search failures. [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- This story must satisfy the 2-second SLA for search results defined in the PRD. [Source: docs/prd/epic-2-part-identification-catalog-integration.md#story-22-catalog-search-and-browse]

### Testing

- Frontend (Vitest + React Testing Library) coverage in `__tests__/frontend/catalog/catalog-page.test.tsx` must validate AC 2.2.1–2.2.4 & 2.2.7: search input submits queries, filters persist via `useSearchStore`, pagination updates results, detail drawer renders pricing, and error/empty/loading states follow the error-handling strategy with proper `data-testid` hooks. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests; docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-id-guidelines]
- Backend (Vitest with convex-test) suites in `__tests__/backend/catalog/searchParts.test.ts` and `__tests__/backend/catalog/reference-refresh.test.ts` should cover AC 2.2.1–2.2.5 & 2.2.7 by asserting keyword filter behavior, tenant isolation, pagination cursors, refresh orchestrations, and SLA metric emission for ≤2s responses. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests; docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md#key-metrics]
- Integration tests targeting the seeding pipeline (`__tests__/backend/catalog/seed-reference-data.test.ts`) must confirm the script hydrates Bricklink reference tables from local XML/JSON assets and records sync timestamps. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#bricklinkcolorreference; docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#catalog-data-refresh-lifecycle]
- End-to-end scenarios in `e2e/catalog/catalog-search.spec.ts` (Playwright) should walk through search → filter → pagination → detail modal and validate market pricing visibility plus error messaging with mocked Bricklink fallbacks, satisfying AC 2.2.1–2.2.7. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#e2e-tests]

## Project Structure Notes

- Catalog work continues within the established authenticated route and Convex catalog domain, matching the documented project layout; no structural deviations required. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture; docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
