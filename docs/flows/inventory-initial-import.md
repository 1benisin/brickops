Inventory Initial Import

Sign In / Navigate to Settings → Development - Owner reaches the Development tools tab where marketplace import controls live.
Preview BrickLink Inventory (optional) - Owner clicks "Preview" to fetch a sample of BrickLink lots. BrickOps shows counts and flags lots that already exist locally.
Preview BrickOwl Inventory (optional) - Owner previews BrickOwl lots to confirm BrickOps can map BrickOwl BOIDs to BrickLink parts.
Import BrickLink Lots - Owner runs "Import All Lots". BrickOps adds missing lots as inventory items and records marketplace metadata without enabling sync.
Import BrickOwl Lots - Owner runs "Import All Lots". BrickOps adds mapped BrickOwl lots and reports any items that could not be matched.
Review Import Summary - Owner reviews the success counts and any errors surfaced in the Development tools callout.
Enable Marketplace Sync (optional) - After validating inventory, owner enables auto-sync in Settings → Integrations. BrickOps now resumes marketplace sync using the imported baseline.
