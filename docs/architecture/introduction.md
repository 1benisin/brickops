# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for BrickOps, combining backend systems and frontend implementation with their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach consolidates what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents into one, streamlining development for a modern fullstack application built with Next.js and Convex.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD, BrickOps is built as a Next.js 14+ application with Convex for backend services. No specific starter template is used; the project starts from the standard Next.js setup with Convex integration.

Decision: Start from Next.js standard setup with Convex integration to allow maximum customization for complex inventory management and API integrations.
